# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Exploratory Project

## Overview
This repository contains my exploratory work on Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), a statistical approach to analyze how marketing activities (e.g., TV, radio, digital ads) impact sales. The goal is to learn MMM techniques through six progressive use cases, building skills to prepare for a final, real-world-like MMM project. The experiments use simple, publicly available datasets from Forecastegy.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of MMM and its application in marketing analytics.

- Experiment with modeling techniques like linear regression, ad stock, seasonality, and budget optimization.

- Build a foundation for a comprehensive MMM project with real-world applicability.
